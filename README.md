# Maze_solver
The project is a graphical user interface (GUI) based maze solver.The maze is represented as an n x n grid, where each cell can either be a source, a destination, or an obstacle. The source and destination are unique cells in the grid, while obstacles can be placed in any other cell. The objective of the project is to find a path from the source to the destination while avoiding obstacles. This is achieved using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It uses a stack data structure to remember to get the next vertex to start a search when a dead end occurs in any iteration.In the context of this project, DFS starts at the source cell and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking . This project is an excellent way to understand the working of the DFS algorithm and its application in pathfinding problems. It also provides hands-on experience with GUI development and event-driven programming. The project could be further extended by adding features like allowing the user to create their own mazes, or implementing different pathfinding algorithms for comparison
